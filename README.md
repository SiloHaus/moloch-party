# MOLOCH.PARTY

## OBJECTIVE

Kickstarter for Manifold NFT Collections on Optimism | Base.

Each Campaign has two Tiers:

* TierI: Mint PfP
* TierII: Custom Art Mint

All NFTs minted are part of the same Contract | Collection, and have sequential TokenIDs.

The purpose of these campaigns is to raise and build DAO owned LP, to farm on Aerodrome and Sudoswap.

## STRATEGY

DAO owned LP for target projects -- such as Thales-USDC LP farms an AERO token. The DAO locks that veAERO and uses the voting power to extract bribes, or build out DAO owned LP for $BAAL.

## FUNDS

Funds are split between artistVault and molochVault.

### artistVault

The artist is the leader | admin | creator of campaigns.

* Commissions Premium goes directly to artistVault
* artistShare goes directly to artistVault

artistVault is the managerVault for the Moloch Treasury, and is not RQ.

### molochVault

* DAO owned LP for a Target Project
  * Example: Thales

* DAO owned Sudoswap LP for that collection
* DAO owned LP for a $BAAL Token.
