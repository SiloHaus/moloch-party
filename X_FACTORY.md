### Steps for Creating the Project

1. **Develop Smart Contracts**:
   - **CampaignFactory**: Manages creation of campaign contracts.
   - **Tier0Factory, TierIFactory, TierIIFactory**: Each manages creation of tier-specific reward mechanisms.

2. **Deploy Factories**: Deploy all factory contracts to the blockchain.

3. **Build a Website**:
   - Interface for creating campaigns.
   - Integrates with Ethereum for interacting with factory contracts.

4. **Integrate Web3**: Use Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interactions on the website.

5. **Test**: Thoroughly test contracts and website functionality on testnet.

### Thoughts on Decentralization and Governance

- **Tokenized Governance**: Distribute governance tokens for decision-making on new campaigns or changes.
- **Rewarding Contributors**: Use tokens to reward contributions from backers, artists, and others.
- **Campaign Percentage to DAO**: Allocate a portion of campaign funds to support the DAO and its initiatives.

### Final Note

Start simple, then iterate based on feedback and needs.
